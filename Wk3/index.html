<p> My name is Omar Ocon Decena and I'm currently learning how to create a website.</p>
<p> I have a lot of expectations in this subject so i will put them in a list</p>

<ol><strong>
    <li>Im hoping to create a portfolio of myself using the knowledge that I would gain in this subject</li>
    <li>To be able to comprehend how websites work and its wireframe</li>
    <li>To hone my skills in order to become a tech-inclined individual</li>
</strong></ol>

<p>I hope that you'll follow me along my journey!</p>
